# Data Structure Programming Questions in Java

Welcome to the **Data Structure Programming Questions Repository**! This repository is designed to help students, professionals, and interviewees master data structures through a comprehensive set of programming problems. The problems range from beginner to advanced levels, each with complete programming solutions in Java.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections based on difficulty level:

1. **Beginner Level**
   - Introduction to basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
   - Simple problems focusing on fundamental operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and basic sorting.
   - Ideal for those new to programming or data structures.

2. **Intermediate Level**
   - Problems covering more complex data structures like trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps.
   - Includes common interview questions that require a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms.
   - Focuses on problem-solving techniques such as recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

3. **Advanced Level**
   - Challenges involving advanced data structures like segment trees, tries, and disjoint-set.
   - Algorithmically intensive problems requiring a deep understanding of optimization, backtracking, and graph theory.
   - Suitable for advanced learners and those preparing for competitive programming or high-level technical interviews.

## How to Use This Repository

- **For Students**: Start with the beginner section and progress through the levels as your understanding deepens. Each problem comes with a detailed solution in Java, explaining the thought process and code structure.
- **For Interview Preparation**: Focus on the intermediate and advanced sections, where you'll find questions commonly asked in technical interviews, along with optimized solutions and explanations.
- **For Practice**: Tackle problems in any order based on your comfort level. The repository is designed to be flexible, allowing you to pick and choose problems to work on.


Happy coding, and good luck with your learning and interview preparation!
